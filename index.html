                      </h3>
                      <p>
                        Smart garments show strong potential for rehabilitation
                        and posture monitoring, yet most existing systems focus
                        on full-body or lower-limb applications. Upper-body
                        tracking, especially in toddlers, remains underexplored,
                        despite known risks of poor early posture. A major
                        barrier is the reliance on large motion capture
                        datasets, which are time-consuming and difficult to
                        collect. I hypothesize that a real2sim2real machine
                        learning pipeline, translating between motion capture
                        data and sensor readings, will accelerate soft suit
                        development and can be adapted for toddler systems. The
                        first aim focuses on collecting adult motion capture and
                        sensor data to create joint angle arrays, simulate
                        motion in Genesis, and train a regression model to
                        predict the motion capture data. The second aim adapts
                        this pipeline for toddlers using pediatric motion data
                        and scaled modeling. My goal is to create a scalable
                        pipeline that reduces dependence on physical data
                        collection and enables real-time, sensor-driven posture
                        monitoring for both adults and children.

                      <p>
                        The lungs are essential organs responsible for
                        exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood
                        and the environment, a process vital for maintaining the
                        body's homeostasis 1. Lung cancer ranks as the second
                        most common cancer in humans, with projections for 2024
                        indicating over 230,000 new cases and approximately
                        125,000 fatalities in the United States alone 2. These
                        figures surpass the combined mortality rates of breast,
                        colon, and prostate cancers. Lung cancer occurs when
                        cells in the lungs grow uncontrollably, often due to
                        genetic mutations and exposure to carcinogens like
                        tobacco smoke and environmental pollutants, which cause
                        direct DNA damage and lead to tumor development 3.
                        Additional risk factors include family history and the
                        use of certain dietary supplements 2. Currently,
                        low-dose computed tomography (LDCT), shown in figure 1,
                        is the primary method for lung cancer screening,
                        capturing lung images to detect cancer presence.
                        However, the US Preventive Services Task Force
                        recommends LDCT screening only for adults aged 50 to 80
                        years with a 20-year smoking history who currently smoke
                        or have quit within the past 15 years 4. This criterion
                        may leave some individuals undetected until it is too
                        late. Additionally, while low-dose computed tomography
                        (LDCT) exposes patients to significantly less radiation
                        than conventional CT scans, the radiation dose of
                        approximately 1.4 mSv is still substantial, given that
                        the average natural exposure to radiation for a person
                        ranges from 3 to 5 mSv annually5. High levels of
                        radiation exposure can elevate the risk of cancer,
                        sterility, hair loss, reduced thyroid function, and
                        radiation burns on the skin6. Balancing the probability
                        of detecting lung cancer and the associated costs and
                        risks of LDCT screenings presents a significant
                        challenge. From 2016 to 2020, one-fourth of diagnosed
                        lung cancers were found at the local stage with a 5-year
                        relative survival rate of 58%; another fourth were found
                        at the regional stage, with a survival rate of 33%;
                        while almost half were diagnosed at the distant stage,
                        where the survival rate drops to 8% 7. The National Lung
                        Screening Trial (NLST) revealed that LDCT had an average
                        false-positive rate of 23.3% per screening round,
                        leading to high costs and repeated low-dose radiation
                        exposure, which increases cancer risk 8. In our modern
                        society, machine learning and artificial intelligence
                        (AI) have become crucial for advancing healthcare
                        technology. AI enables computers to mimic human
                        cognitive functions, using math and logic to simulate
                        reasoning similar to human decision-making 9. Machine
                        learning, a subset of AI, involves teaching computers to
                        recognize patterns in data and apply this understanding
                        to new tasks 9. Currently, 22% of firms are pursuing AI
                        integration, 33% are engaging in limited implementation,
                        and 45% are still exploring its use, reflecting its
                        significant growth 10. Machine learning is extensively
                        explored in healthcare for applications such as cancer
                        detection (including skin, breast, and brain cancers,
                        etc) 11, medical imaging 12, personalized treatment
                        plans 13, and drug responses 14. Regarding lung cancer
                        prediction, we propose a method to balance the
                        trade-offs of lung cancer screening guidelines and
                        reduce false-positive rates by utilizing machine
                        learning to predict lung cancer risk based on personal
                        health data. Previous studies have shown promise in this
                        area. Hart et al. demonstrated the potential of using an
                        artificial neural network to predict lung cancer risk
                        with an AUC of approximately 0.86 using NHIS adult
                        survey files from the CDC website 15. Additionally,
                        Chandran et al. developed a high-dimensional model using
                        least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO
                        model) trained on Optum’s de-identified Electronic
                        Health Record dataset, achieving an AUC of 0.76 16.
                        Despite the abundance of research on using machine
                        learning models to predict lung cancer risk, our paper
                        focuses on the practical application of implementing
                        such models into an electronic health record system.
                        Specifically, we address the challenge of missing data
                        when using neural networks in a clinical setting. We
                        developed two models: the "feature rich" model, which
                        uses a variety of personal health data features to
                        predict lung cancer, and the "feature streamlined"
                        model, which examines subsets of features to identify
                        the best imputation methods for accurate predictions.
                        Our goal is to determine feature importance and optimize
                        the questions doctors should ask to enhance the model's
                        performance.
